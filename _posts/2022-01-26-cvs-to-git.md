    Migrate a Legacy CVS Repository to Git

In the 1990s and early 2000s, the _Concurrent Versions System_ ([CVS](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs)) was one of the most popular systems to manage source code repositories. However, the software was replaced by _Subversion_ ([SVN](https://subversion.apache.org/)) in the middle of the 2000s. The development of the original CVS implementation was ended in 2008. Since around 2010, [git](https://git-scm.com/) is one of the most popular systems in this field. This article deals with the challenge of migrating a legacy CVS repository to git in the year 2022.

An easy solution for the migration might be to checkout the latest version of the repository, take the files and create a new git repository from them. This might work, but the entire history (e.g., old file revisions, commit messages, branches, tags) are lost. In this howto, the history of the repository is also converted.

This howto consists of two parts. In the first part, the existing CVS repository is converted into git in one bulk operation. In the second part, changes committed in CVS after the bulk migration are incrementally merged into the git repository. This might be useful when you migrate the repository and the actual development still uses the CVS repository and you need to get the most recent changes into git. I have used this for several weeks. The git repository was used as a read-only repository, while the actual development still uses CVS. After the git repository works and the build pipeline works as expected, the CVS server was disabled and the development uses git directly.

## Prerequisite

To perform the migration, direct file system access to the CVS repository is needed. The direct access is needed to access all old revisions of the contained files. I have used a Debian 10 system for performing the migration. To perform the bulk migration, I used the tool `cvs2git`, which is part of the `cvs2svn` package. To perform the incremental updates, I used the `git cvs` command, which is part of the `git-cvs` package. Both packages can be installed by using the following command:

```shell
apt install cvs2svn git-cvs
```

## Bulk Migration of the Existing CVS Repository

In the first step, the current version of the raw CVS repository needs to be copied to the local system. It is assumed that the CVS repository is located in the directory `mysoftware-cvsrepo`. Before the migration can be performed, a configuration for `cvs2git` has to be created. A template for the migration can be found in the directory `/usr/share/doc/cvs2svn/examples/`. This template can be used and adjusted.


```shell
cp /usr/share/doc/cvs2svn/examples/cvs2git-example.options.gz .
gunzip cvs2git-example.options.gz
```

In `CVS` commits belong to the username of the CVS-Server. In git, commits are associated to an e-mail address. To assign the old commits to the proper git user, a mapping can be created in the file (see the `author_transforms` setting). However, this is an optional step. Without the mapping, the repository can still be converted. At least the location of the CVS repository has to be adjusted in `run_options.set_project(`. The first value of the call has to point to the directory `mysoftware-cvsrepo`. Afterward, the migration can be performed as follows:

```
cvs2git --options=cvs2git-example.options --fallback-encoding utf8

The command might take a while and prints a few statistics about the migration. In this example, a 20-year-old repository was migrated and 25233 commits were created. The result of the operation are two files `git-blob.dat` and `git-dump.dat` in the directory `cvs2git-tmp`. The files contain all the needed data to populate a new git repository with all files and the entire project history. This can be done with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir gitrepo
cd gitrepo
git init .
cat ../cvs2git-tmp/git-{blob,dump}.dat | git fast-import

```

Also the `git import` command will show some staticstics. Afterward, the git repository is ready. The current directory should contain all the files of the latest CVS checkout. In addition, commands `git log` can be used to view the commit history. The local git repository can now be pushed to services like GitHub. For example, as follows:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:jnidzwetzki/mysoftware.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
git push origin --tags
```

## Import Incremental Updates into Git

After the CVS repository was bulk converted to git, some commits might be performed in the existing CVS repository. To import the last changes from SVN into git without repeating the whole migration, the command `git cvsimport` can be used. This command requires two things: (1) an optional mapping between CVS accounts and e-mail addresses and (2) access to the SVN server.

As in the bulk migration, the mapping is optional. A file has to be created which has lines in the format `cvs-user=email`. In my example, the file looks as follows:

```
cat commiter-mapping

nidzwetzki=Jan Nidzwetzki <jnidzwetzki@gmx.de>
[...]
```

Afterward, the incremental migration can be performed as follows:

```bash
cd gitrepo
git cvsimport -v -a -A ../commiter-mapping -d :pserver:username@cvsserver:2401/cvs mysoftware -o main
git push
```
