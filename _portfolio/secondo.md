I maintain the [SECONDO](https://secondo-database.github.io) database, an extensible database management system developed at the University of Hagen. SECONDO can be extended with _Algebra Modules_ that implement custom data models and operators, focusing on spatial and spatio-temporal data. I also developed [Distributed SECONDO](https://secondo-database.github.io/DSecondo/DSECONDO-Website/index.html), a [distributed version](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-22363-6_28) of SECONDO. Furthermore, I contributed to the development of SECONDO during my time as a student at the University of Hagen.

The focus of SECONDO lies on extensibility and flexibility. The system provides a modular architecture that allows developers to easily add new data types, operators, and query processing techniques. This makes SECONDO suitable for research and development in various domains, including spatial databases and spatio-temporal data management.
