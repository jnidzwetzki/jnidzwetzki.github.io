I maintain the [SECONDO](https://secondo-database.github.io) database kernel, an extensible database management system developed at the University of Hagen. SECONDO is a research prototype of a DBMS that can be extended with _Algebra Modules_ that implement custom data models and operators, focusing on spatial and spatio-temporal data. 

The focus of SECONDO lies on extensibility and flexibility. The system provides a modular architecture that allows developers to easily add new data types, operators, and query processing techniques. The system can be queried by specifying SQL-like queries or low-level query plans. This makes SECONDO suitable for research and development in various domains, including spatial databases and spatio-temporal data management.
