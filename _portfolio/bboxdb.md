My PhD project is [BBoxDB](https://bboxdb.org), a distributed key-bounding-box-value database. BBoxDB is a NoSQL database for multi-dimensional data, implemented from scratch (see [full paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10619-019-07275-w)). With BBoxDB Streams, the software can also process multi-dimensional data streams and execute continuous queries (e.g., continuous range queries and continuous spatial joins, see the [full paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10619-022-07408-8)).
